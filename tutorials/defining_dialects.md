In this tutorial we will focus on the core compilation abstraction used in MLIR. 
- [Attribute](#how-to-define-an-attribute)
- [Operation](#how-to-define-an-operation)
- [Dialect](#how-to-package-all-into-a-dialect)

# How to define an **Attribute**

### Attribute vs. TypeAttribute 
In MLIR attribute and type attributes are two distinct concepts, however their implementations often overlap and since 
The general form of an attribute is `#dialect.attribute<...>`.
And the general form of a type attribute is `!dialect.attribute<...>`
